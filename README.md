# Password Generator - pgen
pgen is a command-line password generator that creates secure passwords
using a list of words like that one xkcd comic. You can specify word count
and what delimiters to use. Randomly capitalizes things and inserts a
digit randomly for added complexity.

Usage:
```
pgen
fleasLeftdevourer2Slyly
```
```
pgen -n 5 -d "-"
our-Director-africa8-Rinds
```
